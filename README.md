# Synergy Pharmaceutical

### Project Description:

Implements the functionality of a pharmacy where users can log in or register via API calls on a web page. After registering and authenticating, users will be able to see a list of medications available, a log of their refills, and request to purchase certain medications. Pharmacists will be able to maintain the medication database, accept or reject requests, view logs of users who purchased a specific medication, and view medication which is almost out of stock. This will be accomplished using the Spring Framework with a React frontend.
